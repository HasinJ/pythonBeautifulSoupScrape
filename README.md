BeautifulSoup Doc:

https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#

Files:

Report.xls - xls file with data to parse

courseProj.py - allsides.com example

output - html example of xls file and webpage

{date}Output.json - outputs the data list


HTML analysis:
- differentiated with CSS
- differentiated with class
- 'Data' and 'DataEven' are the same but different colors
- 'break' breaks down with no values, but 'breaktotal' breaks the opposite way AND has values
- grabbing last child from 'tbody' shows us the amount of loops to go through

Notes:
- date and PC number needs to be associated with each row (data frame-wise)
